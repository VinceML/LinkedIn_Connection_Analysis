# LinkedIn_Connection_Analysis
## WHY
This simple Notebook is for me to understand who I am connected to, and thereby might reach with my posts and networking.

## WHAT
I wanted to anslyse the Connections.csv file, as exported from LinkedIn, to understand:
1. What types of people (positions, industries etc) I am connected to,
2. How long I have known them

## HOW
- Using Python, REGEX and the NTLK library, I could efficiently dissect strings to extract, then count Keywords, Bigrams (word pairs), Trigrams etc
- I also used Matplotlib and a Pareto to simply visualise those outputs
