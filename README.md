# LinkedIn_Connection_Analysis
## WHY
This simple Notebook is for me to understand who I am connected to, and thereby might reach with my posts and networking, ie:
1. What types of people (positions, industries etc) I am connected to,
2. How long I have known them

## HOW
- Analyse the Connections.csv file, as exported from LinkedIn
- I have inferred the WHO, by using Python, REGEX and the NTLK library, to efficiently dissect strings in my connections' POSITION and COMPANY details, then count Keywords, Bigrams (word pairs), Trigrams etc
- I also used Matplotlib and a Pareto to simply visualise those outputs
